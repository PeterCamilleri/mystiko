# The Mystik&oacute; Challenge

In this folder you will find the challenge.bin file. This file contains the
output of the mystico program. It is a encrypted version of a bit of text.

The **Challenge?** **Crack** the **Code**; **Recover** the **Data**; If you can!

Prizes? Well at present none beyond fame and notoriety. I will try and
see if I can find a sponsor for something a little better and will update
this note as more information and goodies become available.
