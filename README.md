# Mystik&oacute;

The word mystik&oacute; is from the Greek language and means secret. Keeping
secrets safe from unauthorized eyes is the very core purpose of encryption.

Over the next few months, this code repo will grow to contain an introduction
to encryption aimed at those who are curious about how it works.

This will be done in a number of parts:

 - A look at the basic machinery common to all encryption systems.
 - A look at some famous (and infamous) encryption systems used through history.
 - The mystiko gem, written in ruby, that serves as a simple demonstration of
   the principles of data encryption.
 - A challenge. For as long as secret codes have existed, secret code breakers
   have tried to defeat them. Coming soon, see if you can decode a secret
   message created by the above ruby code. Prizes, if any, to be determined!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mystiko'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mystiko

The mystiko gem itself will soon be found at: ( https://rubygems.org/gems/mystiko )

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Contributing

Creating a good introduction to encryption is quite an undertaking. For
this reason, any input is most welcomed. There are two basic plans by which
this can be accomplished.

#### Plan A

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/mystiko/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

#### Plan B

Go to the GitHub repository and raise an issue calling attention to some
aspect that could use some TLC or a suggestion or an idea.
